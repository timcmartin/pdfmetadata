Pdfchart
================

A utility to add Metadata to PDF files, primarily for importing into the forScore iOS app.
Title, Composer, Genres, Tags, Rating, Difficulty, Duration and Key can be set in the PDF Metadata so that is unified for everyone who imports that PDF into forScore.

My personal workflow is to create lead sheets in Sibelius, export the PDF then run it through this utility to add the missing data before importing to forScore.
